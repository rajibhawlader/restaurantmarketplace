   turns out IE does not like to load two frames infinitly at the same
   time.. WTF.. I have the code there but commented out.  
 - added a field to `livehelp_config` ADD `use_flush ` VARCHAR( 10 ) DEFAULT 'YES' NOT NULL ;
 - fixed upgrade in setup.php so that older version users can upgrade to new version.
 - added support for non-flush() servers. Servers that insist on buffering the output
   until the entire page is loaded...
 - When you click on log out it marks your status now as offline..

version 1.2: (Released: 04-28-03)
=================
 - As it turns out The HTTP Authentication hooks in PHP are only available 
   when it is running as an Apache module and is hence not available in 
   the CGI version which was causing internal server error on a few peoples
   installations. I re-programmed user_access.php to use a cookie login. 
 - get_magic_quotes_gpc is now used instead of get_ini to see if the user
   has magic quotes on or off and a new extraction is used in config.php 
   to extract the global vars and add slashes. (I like magic quotes) 
 - Added a LOG OUT button to allow operators to close the admin.
 - took out javascript alert for new user in chat and replaced with 
   java sound wav.
 - added referer to the details of the user.. I will make it look better in 
   a later version...
 - Fixed issue with leave a messsage window always poping up if the user 
   was requested for a chat then went away and then came back again when 
   the operator was not around.. 
 - added additional check in setup to make sure users with txt-db-api can 
   write to their text database.

version 1.1: (Released: 04-27-03)
=================
 - Added installation directions and change log txt files.
 - Added support for new $_POST $_GET and $_COOKIE that 
   replace the $HTTP_*_VARS in newer versions of php.
 - Created a new field in livehelp_operator_channels table
   called "bgcolor" of type varchar (10). This field allows
   me to color code the users to allow it to be easier to 
   separate the chatting users.. 
 - Fixed bug with the leave a message script where the 
   e-mail from address was not being sent.
 - Fixed bug with users entering in the same username or name as
   an already exisiting user.
 - Fixed issue with the "new user in chat"
   prompt showing before the user enters their name if 
   ask for name option is selected.
 - magic quotes for words with apostrophes
 - If user selects not to have the leave the message option on
   and no one is online the credit line remained. Took that image
   out if leave a message is not enabled.

version 1.0: (Released: 04-21-03)
